Used libraries: [EcPy](https://pypi.org/project/ECPy/)

Curve: bn254, base points: (1, 2) and others generated by generators.py


## Usage 
Run `python3 range_verify.py`

Provable value is defined in range_create.py.

range_create.py generates a dict to verify

range_verify.py verifies a dict, generated by create()

## Specs
Proof of n bit value.
Size: 2 scalars, 2 EC points, n scalars any size (can be reduced to 8 bits), 1 hidden value

Verify operations: n + 5 ec_mul, n + 3 ec_add
